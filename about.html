  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m Fahim — a Computer Science and Engineering student who treats coding like chronicling history: every project has a story, every bug a twist, and every feature a revelation. 
    I don’t just write code; I trace its essence. I ask “why?” until I understand not only how something works, but why it exists that way. 
    I don’t sleep well until a project is fully complete, every bug vanquished, every feature polished — sometimes unfinished problems even nudge me in my dreams, new features appear, and solutions reveal themselves in ways only my subconscious could imagine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond code, I’m endlessly curious about the world and the universe. 
    I love exploring space, pondering the mysteries of physics, and tracing the connections between the cosmos and the logic that governs it. 
    History, human behavior, and patterns of thought fascinate me, and I enjoy observing, analyzing, and reflecting — often alone, intentionally, because solitude is when my mind thrives. 
    Travel excites me, even if I haven’t officially embarked on many journeys yet; I imagine every adventure as a story waiting to be lived.
  </p>

  <p>
    I value ideas, persistence, and yes — money too. 
    I believe in building something meaningful, seeing it through to completion, and enjoying both the process and the outcome. 
    I build systems where logic meets creativity, precision meets curiosity, and work meets just enough chaos to keep it interesting. 
    Life, like code, is best approached with focus, purpose, and just the right touch of humor — because even in logic, there’s always room to laugh.
  </p>

  <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
  <p>
  I spend my time watching movies, enjoying good food, relaxing and thinking (sometimes overthinking), catching up on sleep, occasionally laughing at my own code errors, and dreaming of making money in a snap.
  </p>
